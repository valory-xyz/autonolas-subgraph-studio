A Service entity represents a single autonomous service created by the registry.
The ID is the address of the service's multisig wallet, making it unique.

This entity acts as a 'seen' list to ensure we only count a service once per day.
The ID is a composite key: {dayTimestamp}-{serviceAddress}, which guarantees uniqueness
for each service on any given day. Its existence implies activity.
